# Mathematical Foundations

All those foundational math concepts that we usually learn in high school or bachlelor's and forget thereafter.

These concepts are a prerequisite for understanding several advanced topics in computer science like quantum computing, machine learning, algorithms, complexity theory and so on.
 
Each chapter generally consists of the following structure : 
 - Topic
 - Sub Topic
 - Definition in Simple English
 - Followed by Simple Examples
 - Related Properties, Points & Notes if any
 - Ending with some Solved Exercises
 - and Reference Sources

Disclaimer : These are my math notes, primarily based on Indian NCERT math text books, classes 9 to 12.
