# Mathematical Foundations

All those foundational Math topics that we usually learn in high school or bachlelor's and forget thereafter ;)

These are necessary for understanding various topics in Computer Science like Algorithms, Complexity Theory, Machine Learning, Quantum Computing and so on.
 
Each chapter generally consists of the following structure : 
 - Topic
 - Sub Topic
 - Definition in Simple English
 - Followed by Simple Examples
 - Related Properties, Points & Notes if any
 - Some Solved Exercises
 - Reference Sources

Disclaimer : These are my math notes, primarily based on Indian NCERT math text books, classes 9 to 12.
