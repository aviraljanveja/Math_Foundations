# Mathematical Foundations
All those foundational math topics that we usually learn in High school or Bachlelor's and forget thereafter ;)

These are necessary for understanding various topics in Computer Science like Algorithms, Complexity Theory, Machine Learning, Quantum Computing and so on.
 
Each Chapter generally consists of the following structure : 
 - Topic
 - Sub Topic
 - Definition in Simple English
 - Followed by a Simple Example
 - Related Properties, Points & Notes if any
 - Ending the chapter with some Solved Exercises

Disclaimer : These notes are primarily based on Indian NCERT math text books, classes 9 to 12.
