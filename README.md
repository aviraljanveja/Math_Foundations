# Mathematical Foundations

All those foundational math concepts that we usually learn in high school or bachlelor's and forget thereafter. These concepts are a prerequisite for understanding several advanced topics in computer science like quantum computing, machine learning, algorithms and so on.
 
Each chapter generally consists of the following : 
 - concepts illustrated via simple examples.
 - Meaning and definition in simple terms.
 - Related points and notes if any.
 - Some solved exercises.
 - and reference sources.
