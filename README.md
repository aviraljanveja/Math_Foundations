# Mathematical Foundations

Fundamental math concepts that we usually learn in school or bachlelors and forget thereafter. These concepts are a prerequisite for understanding several advanced topics in computer science like quantum computing, machine learning, algorithms and so on.
 
Each chapter generally consists of the following : 
 - Concepts explained through simple examples.
 - Definitions in simple terms.
 - Related points and notes if any.
 - Some solved exercises.
 - Reference sources.
